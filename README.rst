Lye
===

Lye is a simple, straightforward library for expressing musical grooves as
compositions of small snippets of music. It could be thought of as an
extremely complex music box.

Lye takes in snippets of Lilypond markup written in a strict set of Lilypond,
called Lye, and outputs MIDI data, either in realtime or to a MIDI file for
later playback.
